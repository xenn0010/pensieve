# Supabase Setup Guide for Pensieve CIO

This guide walks you through setting up Supabase as the database backend for your Pensieve CIO autonomous intelligence system.

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup

### 1. Create Supabase Project
1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create a new account
2. Create a new project
3. Choose a strong database password
4. Wait for project initialization (2-3 minutes)

### 2. Get Your Credentials
From your Supabase dashboard:
- **Project URL**: `https://your-project-id.supabase.co`

## ðŸ”’ Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
- **Never commit** your service role key to version control
- **Use different keys** for development and production
- **Rotate keys regularly** in production environments

### Database Security
- RLS policies protect sensitive data

SELECT * FROM critical_events_24h;

-- Check system health overview
SELECT * FROM system_health_overview;
```
